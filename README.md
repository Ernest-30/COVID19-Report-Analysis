# COVID19-Report-Analysis

# Introduction

The primary objective of this project was to gain insights into the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and countries of the world. 

The analysis process involved in this project includeds; exploring COVID-19 data using SQL and visualizing the results in Tableau.

The data was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), then was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using SQL to gain insights and extract relevant information  such as the number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations, Top countries negatively impacted by the virus.


# Analysis

Analysis was done on SQL.[Analysis] (https://github.com/Ernest-30/COVID19-Report-Analysis/blob/main/COVID19%20REPORT%20ANALYSIS.sql)
