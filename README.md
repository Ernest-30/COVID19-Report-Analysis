# COVID19-Report-Analysis

# Introduction

The primary objective of this project was to gain insights into the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and countries of the world. 

The analysis process involved in this project includeds; exploring COVID-19 data using SQL and visualizing the results in Tableau.

The data was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), then was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using SQL to gain insights and extract relevant information  such as the number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations, Top countries negatively impacted by the virus.The dataset range is from January 2020 to January 2023.


# Analysis

Analysis was done on SQL. [Analysis](https://github.com/Ernest-30/COVID19-Report-Analysis/blob/main/COVID19%20Analysis.sql) 

Below are the major findings and insgihts from the analysis;

Total Population =	8,042,792,231

Total Cases	= 665,274,511

Total Deaths = 6,685,880

Infection Percentage	8.27%

Death Percentage	1.00%


The highest recorded impact of the virus was in 2021, with a total of 3,547,772 reported to have died from complications of the virus accross the Globe.This is about 0.04% of the Global Population. 

Europe has been the most affected continent so far with a record of 2,012,728 deaths and 245,671,215 cases of infection. This is means that about 0.27% of the total population has died from the virus while 33% of the population has been Infected. This leaves the death Percentage of about 0.82% in Europe.

The infection rate peaked in 2022, with Europe reported to have about 155,618,739 of the total continent infected. 

The least impacted continents are Oceania and Africa, with Oceania having the lowest death count of about 22,661 (0.05%) of the population. While Africa has the lowest recorded Infection rate with about 12,467,643 (0.87%) of the population reported be infected by the virus.

In Asia, 414,206,211 (8.8%) people have been vaccinated, this makes it the leading continent in terms of vaccination while Oceania has the lowest number of vaccination with about 2,440,594 (5.4%) people vaccinated. 

United States has the highest number of Vaccinations with about 227,590,819 people recorded to have been vaccinated. This is about 67% of the Country's population.
